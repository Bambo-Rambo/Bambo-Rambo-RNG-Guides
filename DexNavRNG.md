# DexNav RNG Abuse Guide

**Because PokeRadar patch RNG was only the beginning!**

After almost 7 years since ORAS came out, it's finally time to officially release 
the tool and the method to manipulate the trickiest of the encounters in generation 6 games.

Abusing the DexNav mechanics, has always been a cool way to obtain unique Pokemon which can have a random egg move (if not genderless), the Hidden Ability (if exists), 
up to 3 perfect guaranteed IVs, various boosts to their level, while some Pokemon outside of the Hoenn Pokedex, cannot be obtained otherwise.

The most impressive feature of DexNav however, is that similarly to PokeRadar in XY games, 
special patches can be generated that result in guaranteed (square) shiny Pokemon.

Now imagine a forced shiny encounter with 3 perfect IVs and all the above.
Really powerful and one of its kind, but also complicated to perform, so having some experience with TinyMT RNG is required.

Please note that while we can abuse for an egg move at the 1st slot, we can't choose which one will be.

Also the following method doesn't work for species that can be obtained by fishing, although DexNav allows it generally.

This guide attempts to give some useful tips to save time and effort but don't expect to succeed without practicing.

I will also be using Hyperlinks with extra useful info, because I don't want to overfill the core of the guide. 
It is suggested not to ignore them.

# Introduction

Before starting, you may want to take a look at some [differences](https://github.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/blob/main/ExtraInfo.md#differences-between-dexnav-and-pokeradar) between PokeRadar and DexNav to get the main idea.

As for the DexNav method itself, there are 2 ways of triggering a hidden encounter:

* The first - which will be used in this guide - is the moving method.
Every 20 steps/turns, and if there is not already an active patch shaking in the overworld, there is a 50% chance of triggering one.
The idea is to make 19 turns (or steps), calibrate/manipulate the RNG, rotate the character at the right time and succeed.

* The second is using the "Search" function in the lower screen. While this method guarantees the species, and has a higher success ratio in some circumstances, 
it's totally not recommended for a number of reasons. 
The main issue is that it takes 2-3 seconds to generate the Pokemon and thus, a lot of things can be messed up during that time namely the delay and of course 
the TinyMT rng state which must be fully controllable (but here instead, is affected by the random NPC movements in most areas).

Tiny Finder currently supports only the former while researches are being made for the latter as well.

# Getting Started

### Step 1 – Choosing the target Index

We give priority to the target index since it cannot be reseeded for, unless you hard reset your system.

We will be reseeding for the main frame afterwards because we don't want to find a nice spread only to realize that we don't have a nice index to combine with.

On how to setup Tiny Finder depending on your preferences, please see [here](https://github.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/blob/main/ExtraInfo.md#tiny-finder-controls).

When you have setup the tool it's time to search, so boot the game.

If on 3ds, connect your console **to 3DS RNG Tool first** then to Tiny Finder using the NTR Helper and when you reach the first loading cutscene, press “Update” in Tiny Finder.

It will read your initial TinyMT state automaticaly, as well as your current step counter and the current chain length (both set to 0 when booting the game obviously).
It will then update the list with possible available results to choose from.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/main/Images/DexNav/DexNav2.png)

If you are doing this on Citra, use the “Date Searcher“ Tab to find the desired index early.

See [here](https://github.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/blob/main/ExtraInfo.md#dexnav-results) how to read the results from Tiny Finder.

**(It's important here to make a brief explanation of how the chain length affects the results:**

Starting at -1, and for every +5, the chances of getting a nice index, greatly increase.
This means that if your current chain length matches one of the following numbers: [4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29 etc], you are more likely to find what you are looking for.
In that case, your target Pokemon is also guaranteed to have the following:
* Egg Move
* A +10 Level Boost
* At least 1 perfect guarananteed IV

(Chain = 49 gives even better results while 99 is the best possible value, but nobody is willing to build such a long chain)

Of course shininess is affected in a positive way as well.

Also starting at 0, and for every +5 added, [5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc] the target Pokemon is guaranteed to have a +1 boost to its level. 
This doesn't affect the standar +10 that you may get. In fact, they can be combined resulting in a possible +29 Level Boost when the chain length tops at 99).

For what described above, the optimal chain length number is 4.
Takes 2-3 minutes to build and is totally worth it unless you are looking for a low level Pokemon so the +10 boost should be avoided.

By the way, as I said earlier, when booting the game, the chain length value is by default 0 so pressing “Update” will set it to zero again.
To check the possible results for a given chain value, set it manually to the tool and press “Search” instead of “Update”.

If you still didn't find the desired index, hard reset your system and try again.

### Step 2 – Choosing the target frame
You have found an index that satisfies you, so it’s time to focus on the main frame and choose the IVs for your target. 

In 3DS RNG Tool, choose "DexNav" and set up the tool **according to your target index** from Tiny Finder.

As shown above, my index guarantees shininess, has the Hidden Ability, successfuly syncs the Nature and it gives 3 perfect IVs (potential) so I set up 3DS RNG Tool like this:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/main/Images/DexNav/DexNav3.png)

If your target is Unown (Mirage Cave only), check the corresponding box to make it show the form - letter for each frame.

Note that the delay tends to be a bit unstable sometimes so it’s better to search for 3-5 consecutive identical frames.
This will also solve the odd/even frame issue.

You may now pick any frame of your choice. 


# Prepartion

If you have filtered the results to the maximum, your target index is most likely very far away and you will need to advance thousands of indexes.
The fastest way, is to fly to a rainy place (Route 120 works, just move down to the map a little and a heavy rain will start). 
You can also activate the Pokemon Amie function at the lower screen of your system.

* Rain advances by 3 indexes per frame advance
* Pokemon Amie advances by 0,5 indexes per frame advance (apparently it doesn't work if you have interacted with strangers in the PSS)
* Combining these 2, results in advancements of 3,5 indexes per frame so you can approximately calculate how much time you need to stay there. Leaving a bit earlier is suggested so you won't miss your index.

In the following image, I make use of both.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/main/Images/DexNav/DexNav4.png)

When you get close to your target index, return to your location and build up the chain if you have to.

Check [here](https://github.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/blob/main/ExtraInfo.md#chain-build) how to build a successful DexNav chain without breaking it.

(If you don't need to build a chain, I suggest returning around ~800 indexes before your target. If you will be building a chain, the suggested number is ~1500).

When you are done with the chains, check the coordinates of your index in Tiny Finder and find an appropriate tile to stand on. 
Remember that the resulting patch must fit INSIDE the grass (or water if you aim for an aquatic encounter).

In any case, you should stand somewhere OUTSIDE of grass or water because when turning inside any of these, causes unwanted advancements.

Press the Update button to refresh the Step Counter, make the remaining steps/turns until it reaches 19 (will be marked as red in that case)
and once again make sure you are on the right spot.

### Finding the noise for your current spot

When closing the X menu and the character is free to move again, the same goes for the NPCs whose influence (blinking/moving) returns.

For Normal Wild the tool takes that into account (since the suggested spots are specific), but since your position in DexNav is different every time, you have to calculate the noise yourself.

Press the 'X' button to open the menu and then freeze the game by pressing Start + Select.

While the game is freezed, hold down the 'X' button and tap select 10 times, in order to close the menu slowly.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/main/Images/DexNav/DexNav6.png)

As you can see, I start unpausing at frame 40113. 
The crucial one is (40113 + 10) = 40123.

At that frame, I notice that the TinyMT state advanced by **2** indexes (expected since there are 2 running NPCs nearby).

This means that I need to set the noise to 2, in order to land at the correct index when I will be doing the actual RNG.

# DexNav RNG

Use the Poke – Amie or let the NPCs advance for you.

When you are about 50-55 indexes away, CLOSE POKE – AMIE and enter the bag (The TinyMT state advances once when entering and then freezes).

In ORAS games, pressing the ‘B’ button to exit the bag, lands you to the X menu. 
During that time, the TinyMT state advances by 15 (27 for XY if matters). 
For both games, in caves and creepy places (like Sky Pillar etc), those advancements are 3.

Since the numbers are predictable, we will be abusing them to avoid the process of matching the target frame with the target index (the whole timeline calibration to be exact).

The idea is to stay inside the bag until you get close to your target MAIN frame and then exit so you can land to your target index as well.

For what described above, the last thing to do, is advance inside the bag until we are 15 indexes away.

(Please note that some places like Mt. Pyre summit, those bag advances are 16 instead of 15. Make a test for your current location/spot to be sure)

Here are some simple ways to advance slowly inside the bag:

* Attempting to teach one of your Pokemon a new move and reject it, advances by 1 (In fact what advances here, is checking the summary screen of the Pokemon). 
Don’t actually teach the move otherwise it will advance more. If you stay in the move replace screen for too long, it will advance by 1 again.
(Helpful for 2 advances but be careful).
* Giving your Pokemon a held item, usually advances by 3. (Rarely by 4, not sure when).
* Turning on/off the EXP Share advances by 3 * number of Party. This means that if you have 4 Pokemon in your party, using the Exp Share, will advance 3 * 4 = 12 indexes etc

Now that you are 15 indexes away, all you need to do is wait until you get ~110 frames before your target.
The bag takes an inconsistent number of frames to close, but exiting 110 frames earlier, always works for me.

Note that inside the bag, the frames advance 1 by 1 instead of 2 by 2 and the frame type (odd/even) you will be at, is the one you were when exited. (The opposite goes for Citra).
This means that if your target frame is 55768, you need to exit the bag at an even frame (55658 in my case).

This is not exactly controllable because, the 'B' and "Start" buttons don't work together. 
Which means that, when freezed, you need to tap Start and immediately B to exit as fast as you can.

I also mentioned in the beginning that you should have a side of your bag empty.
This is neccessary because when an item is highlighted, pressing either start or select, or both to pause, prompts you to sort the item list.

If there are no items though, you can pause without any trouble which is what I am doing here in the Berry List.

(Or you can use the Party instead of the bag but you won't have the Exp Share to advance faster. 

Citra is not affected. You can pause wherever you want since the hotkey is not used elsewhere).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bambo-Rambo/RNG-Guides/main/Images/DexNav/DexNav7.png)

Exit the bag by pressing 'B', freeze the game in the X menu, and keep tapping select until you reach **10** frames before your target.
All you need to do now, is what you did to find the noise and rotate your character.

Hold 'X' and tap select 10 times until you reach your target frame.

If the place is noisy, you will see the TinyMT state changing, don't worry because the tool has already taken this into consideration.

Note that when rotating, you should not take an extra step to the new direction because this will result in hitting a later index.

This is a bit difficult to do precisely on console because you need to press ‘A’ instead of “Select” to make it work, 
but what helps me a lot, is abuse the Pcalc lag by having the stats menu (Start + Left) open as well (in fact that's the reason why I had them both open in the bag).

In any case it requires practice.

If everything done right, you will activate the patch at the expected tile (-8, -3 in my case) and all you need to now is approach slowly and start the encounter.

### Things to NEVER forget

* Exit the bag by pressing 'B' to land in the menu. Pressing 'X' instead, would get you to the overworld, and if the place is noisy, the NPCs would start affecting immediately before you could get control of your character.
* Don't forget to find the noise for your current spot. The spot itself, requires background search. 
If there is an NPC next to the character, when pressing "A" to rotate, you may speak to them accidentaly. 
The same goes for spots where an item can be interacted like a Route sign or a water tile nearby which will prompt you to surf inside it.
* When you have stood on your spot, make sure that your current step counter value is 19 (red marked). 
If neccessary, reset the counter (be careful not to trigger a patch accidentaly) and rotate the character as much as needed to set it from the beginning.
* If you have used Pokemon Amie, make sure to turn it off when entering the bag. 
If it remains in queue, it will start advancing again like crazy when exiting.
* Sometimes after tracking down the target index, I forget to reseed for a nice spread.
