### Differences between DexNav and PokeRadar

* When using the PokeRadar, you have to stand in a grass patch for it to work. For DexNav, you can stand anywhere although for RNG purposes, we will actually be standing outside it. Also PokeRadar usually generates 5 patches (unless they don't fit) while DexNav only 1.
* When using the PokeRadar, the species is decided when chain = 0 and then locks until the chain breaks. With DexNav you have to RNG for the slot as well (at least that's the case with the turn method that we will be using).
* When using the PokeRadar, if chain > 0, you RNG for the shininess first by activating the device, then wait in front of the patch until you reach your target frame to RNG for stats. You also see the patch glowing most of the time. In DexNav, you RNG for everything at once. You don't see the patch glowing but you see it shaking the whole time as well as some info when approaching.
* To get guaranteed IVs from PokeRadar, you have to slowly build the chain (max 60 for 3 perfect IVs), although shiny patches can be generated after chain is 1 or higher. With DexNav you can generate a 1-3IV shiny patch immediately. 
* PokeRadar doesn't have exclusive Pokemon and you can't abuse for some extra add ons like HA, Egg move, Level Boost. DexNav can get you any available Pokemon for a given location including fishing and Horde Pokemon.
* PokeRadar patch RNG is more forgiving. You can activate the Radar device directly from the bag with no frame pressure. Also your patches don't always have to fit inside the grass in order to get what you want. DexNav is way more strict. If the patch doesn't fit, the game advances to a later index attempting to find something that fits. This increases the delay (although it happens more when using the Search method), and of course makes you miss your target.


### Tiny Finder Controls

**Second Tab (Settings)**

The “Surf” box should be checked if your target patch will be inside the water (affects the slots).

The “Shiny Charm” Box should be obvious.

The “Exclusives” box, must be checked **ONLY** if DexNav exclusive Pokemon have a chance to appear.
For a given location, DexNav Pokemon may appear in the grass but not in the water. 
In that case, the button must be checked only if you aim for a grass Pokemon.
It’s important to understand the difference so let’s see some examples:

* At Route 102, your target is Gothita (DexNav exclusive – found in the grass). “Hidden Pokemon” **must** be checked.
* At Route 102, your target is Lotad (not DexNav exclusive). “Hidden Pokemon” **must** still be checked.
* At Route 102, your target is Marill (not DexNav exclusive - found in the water). “Hidden Pokemon” **must NOT** be checked since there are no DexNav exclusives in the water for that route.
* At Route 108, your target is Krabby (DexNav exclusive – found in the water). “Hidden Pokemon” **must** be checked.
* At Route 108, your target is Pelipper (not DexNav exclusive – found in the water). “Hidden Pokemon” **must** still be checked.

Ignore the “Noise” button for now.

“Search Level” is the number of times you have encountered the target Pokemon (shown in the DexNav screen for each Pokemon - caps at 999). Suggested value: 999.

“Chain” is the current chain length (caps at 100). Suggested value: 4.

**Third Tab (Preferences)**

In the “Type” Combobox, choose the desired Encounter Type. 
Normal is for Pokemon that can also appear in the area with Normal Wild RNG, while DexNav is for DexNav exclusives (3 for each area - Some areas don't have excluives).

Pick the desired slot(s) in the second combobox. 
For DexNav Pokemon, the slots can be found in the beginning of the guide.

In the third combobox, fill in the rest of the filters to your preference.

“Success” is for a successfull patch trigger (Works only if you rotate when step counter = 19. Will be explained later in the guide).

“Shiny” for a guaranteed shiny patch.

“HA” for Hidden Ability“ and “Egg move“ for an exclusive breeding move than cannot be obtained otherwise.

“Level Boost” for a +10 to the Level of the resulting Pokemon.

As for “Potential” and “Flute”, the former is the guaranteed perfect IVs you will get for an index (caps at 3), 
while the latter is about the Level drop/boost if the White/Black Flute is activated for that location (caps at 4). 
Leave either to 0 if you don’t care.

### DexNav results

The “Right” and “Up” columns show the coordinates of the generated patch. It should be obvious that negative values, mean opposite direction. 
For example a pair of Right = -8 and Up = -3, means that you will be getting a patch 8 tiles **left** and 3 **down** from the position you will be standing at.
If there is not grass/water in the generated spot, the game will try later indexes so you need to be careful when choosing a tile to stand in.

If success = true, the row will be marked as yellow similarly to what 3DS RNG Tool does for Normal Wild and Friend Safari RNG when an encounter is successful.

Sync, Slot, HA and Egg Move columns need no further explanation.

Shiny is about a Forced shiny patch. 
The row will be marked as blue only if the patch is BOTH shiny AND successful, otherwise will remain white.

As for the Level column, it shows the TOTAL Level Boost for a given index, depending on the situation (value can be from +0 to +30).
We will see later in the guide how this number varies and how to mess with it.

Potential and Flute were explained above.

### Chain Build

To build a DexNav chain, all you need to do is defeat or capture Hidden Pokemon.

They don't have to be DexNav exclusives like Lillipup or Zorua, they can be Zigzagoon, Poochyena etc but they have to be hidden encounters.

This means that running around without repels to trigger a wild encounter by moving in the grass, does **NOT** work.

Run around (or use the search function in the lower screen), to trigger a DexNav shaking patch.

Use a repel to prevent wild encounters and approach the Pokemon slowly using the Circle Pad then either capture or defeat it.

The chain length value is now +1.

Things that break a chain include:

* Scaring the Pokemon by running/walking fast towards it
* Running away from a battle
* Not encountering a hidden Pokemon that has appeared in the overworld either by leaving the area or by waiting too long until it disappears

If you use the Search button to scan for hidden Pokemon and nothing is found, the chain does **NOT** break

### Unstable delays

The delay can be affected by the current's system performance. I have noticed that I get less stable delays when I use the rain at Route 120 to advance fast. 
The 2 following ways can be seen as a workaround to deal with that:

* When reseeding for a specific spread, aim for 2-3 or more consequitive identical frames.
I suggest at least 2 in order to solve the odd/even issue while 3 can deal with the instability.

* As I said, the general system's performance affects the delay.
What I tried, was opening the 2 Pcalc overlays (frame info and wild stats) around 2000 frames before exiting the bag and keep them visible until I rotate the character.
I noticed that this always gives me stable delays for quiet places with no NPCs (even if I have used the rain earlier).
Noisy ones may not be stable because extra advances caused by the NPC influence, might affect the performance.

### Special Places (caves, water, Route 111 desert)

Here are 2 reasons why these places are harder to DexNav RNG on:

* The hidden Pokemon does not stay in the same spot but instead keeps moving constantly inside a new, specific ring. It also disapperars way easier especially if it can't move inside the ring due to your character's presence. Don't even try to build a chain in those areas. At chain 4, the Pokemon shakes literally 3 times before disappearing and you don't have enough time to approach it anyway. For whatever reason, GF decided to make this completely unfair.
* The biggest issue about these places is the small ring in which a patch can be generated in. While for grass is [-9, 9] for both vertical and horizontal, for special places it appears to be way smaller and apparently it varies for every tile in the map. To make it work on 3ds, I use an index on Citra with the same coordinates, and start searching for a tile that can generate my patch. I then use that spot on 3ds to make it work. This requires extra search on the user's side depending on the situation. To make your life easier, keep running around and check where most of the random patches are generated. This will give you a better idea of what to aim for.

### Practicing

The best places for that, are hands down the Mirage Spots (except caves of course).
They are quiet places with no NPC, the bag advancements are the standar +15 and they include large grass tables which give the user a lot of possible patch coordinates to aim for.
They also don't have DexNav exclusive Pokemon that affect the slots.

Practice, practice, practice.
Keep aiming for non shiny indexes and try to hit them. Play around with the Pcalc menus to increase/decrease the lag and use whatever works better for you.

On 3ds you can use the NTR Helper to keep track of the steps and chain length.

On Citra you can find the target index easily without building a chain.

Try everything that you may find useful.

### Conclusions

* Depending on what the user is looking for, this can be either harder or easier than Normal Wild RNG but generally speaking, DexNav RNG is more challenging. While you have a higher chance of triggering a patch (50% unlike 13% and 7% for wild), you also have to deal with higher delay which boosts the NPC influence. Apart from that, if you choose to rotate and not step, you have to single tap the arrow which requires precision. Normal wild is easier on this part because you can just hold down the arrow and the encounter won't be affected. As for indexes, full DexNav ones are more rare of course, but with Tiny Finder filtering the results, this is not really an issue (Don't forget the Date searcher for Citra also). Finally the slot generation is an interesting topic. Their rarity is reversed on DexNav, making slot 12 the most common, slot 11 less common etc. GF probably wanted to give users an alternative and easier way to find those 1-5% targets faster.

* Unlike a possible search method that may occur in the future, this method gives full control of almost everything. Consistency is the key, and if you want a specific flawless Pokemon, you need to have control of both RNG states (MT and TinyMT). Citra allows for more possibilities, but 3ds is most likely to remain in this state.
